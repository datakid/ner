South is installed:

Once a change has been made to app/models.py do this from within a virtualised
environment (otherwise django throws an error, as it uses the wrong django):
$ python manage.py schemamigration app --auto
then
$ python manage.py migrate app

Haystack is installed:
Once a change has been made to app/search_indexes.py, you need to build a new solr index.

./manage.py build_solr_schema > schema.xml
cp schema.xml /opt/solr/solr/conf/

*restart solr* - I can't remember how I set it up (no screens running nothing in 
        /etc or /etc/init.d or /etc/default...?!)

Then:

./manage.py rebuild_index
